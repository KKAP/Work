In the beginning of the eXceed camp we will have handout
username and password to peoples that involve with the
camp(Students, election committee, Professor, Outside observer)
Before the election begins the election committee will
insert screenshots and description of each team.
After the election committee insert the description.
They will create a time frame for the election.
Then during the election all the voters will come log-in
to the program using the username and password that was
given. Then the voters will see all the projects in the
main page. The voters can enter any projects that they wanted.
Then they will vote any categories they want and when 
they vote, the remains of the vote in each voter will
decrease and when there is no votes left the program
will warn the user that there isn't any votes left.
While the election is continuing the election committee
can come and check for the result and the voter that
are voting. When the election is over every voter that
still in the program will be log out. And they can re-enter
the program and see the result.
